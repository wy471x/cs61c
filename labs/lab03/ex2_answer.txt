1. The register representing the variable k.
Answer: t0

2. The register representing the variable sum.
Answer: s0

3. The registers acting as pointers to the source and dest arrays.
Answer: the registers acting as pointers to the source is s1,
        the registers acting as pointers to the dest is s2.

4. The assembly code for the loop found in the C code.
Answer: loop:
            slli s3, t0, 2
            add t1, s1, s3
            lw t2, 0(t1)
            beq t2, x0, exit
            add a0, x0, t2
            addi sp, sp, -8
            sw t0, 0(sp)
            sw t2, 4(sp)
            jal square
            lw t0, 0(sp)
            lw t2, 4(sp)
            addi sp, sp, 8
            add t2, x0, a0
            add t3, s2, s3
            sw t2, 0(t3)
            add s0, s0, t2
            addi t0, t0, 1
            jal x0, loop

5. How the pointers are manipulated in the assembly code.
Answer: The slli instruction computes an offset from the start of the address stored in k.
        This offset is added to s1 and s2 to find the address from which we want to load word.
