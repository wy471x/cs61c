1. What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)? Hint: think about the 4 sections of memory.
Answer:
    the code (instructions basically) are in a segment called .text.
    the pre-initialized data is .data and the uninitialized data is .bss.
    the size of data is .word.

2. Run the program to completion. What number did the program output? What does this number represent?
Answer:
    the program output is 34.
    34 represent result of fib(9).

3. At what address is n stored in memory? Hint: Look at the contents of the registers.
Answer:
    t3 is 0x10000010, so n at 0x10000010.

4. Without actually editing the code (i.e. without going into the “Editor” tab),
   have the program calculate the 13th fib number (0-indexed) by manually modifying the value of a register.
   You may find it helpful to first step through the code. If you prefer to look at decimal values,
   change the “Display Settings” option at the bottom.
Answer:
   mofifying the value of t3, we can look result is 233.
